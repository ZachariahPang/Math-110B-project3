        "# Compression with Constraints: Steganography\n",
        "\n",
        "The natural images are compressible, usually a full size image of several megabytes can be reduced to kilobytes level easily without lossing too much important information. Such property has been used widely to denoising, deblur, etc. techniques. \n",
        "\n",
        "The [``steganography``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is a topic lying in the cryptography. It is concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. \n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message ***does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny***. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal. \n",
        "\n",
        "Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we deal with a special case: stegranography with images only. So unlike many practical scenes, for instance, encrypt text, document in images, this task might not be able to produce perfect recovery of information."

On the other hand, it also provides a challenge to think about how to detect the ``steganographic`` images without the original images."

        "\n",
        "The stegranography has two important components: encryption and decryption. \n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have an original image and a secret image.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Encryption: As a sender, your task is to make the original image and secret image merge into one image. The purpose is two fold. Firstly, your outcome must be an image, if this image stays far away from the original image, then it will attract other people's attention. That will count as a failure. Secondly, your outcome image must also convey the information of the secret image. It is not that simple, since any blending of information will change each other. The problem is how much we can afford.\n",
        "2.   Decryption: After the encryption part, your outcome image will have two parts of information coming from original image and the secret image. As the receiver, your task will be inverting the encryption process, to recover the secret image as much as possible (Caution,  the receiver do not care about original image). \n",
        "\n",
        "If we mathematically represent such process, let $x$ be the original image, $y$ is the secret image, then $z = E(x, y)$ is the encrypted image, $E$ is the encryption function. You will try to minimize \n",
        "$$\\|z - x\\|$$\n",
        "The above norm is in certain sense, we will discuss that later. However, above minimization will subject to another constraint, which is the decryption function $D$ can recover sufficient information of the secret image. That is \n",
        "$$\\|D(z) - y\\|$$\n",
        "should be as small as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is possible to construct a unified objective function:\n",
        "$$\\min_{E, D} \\|x - E(x,y)\\| + \\gamma \\|y - D(z)\\|$$\n",
        "where $E$ and $D$ are the parameters to find. $\\gamma$ is a parameter chosen at your choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, there are other constraints from the images, because images are pixels, each pixel contains 3 channels: R,G,B, each one is a 8-bit integer, goes from 0 to 255. If the image has 4 channels RGBA, then it will provide more information. Therefore above optimization problem also has constraints that $E(x,y)$ and $D(z)$ must be images. \n",

        "\n",

In this way, the change in the original image could be small (on average).  There are other ways to alter the LSB, like treating the secret image as a binary string , and evenly distribute to each pixel. ***In our case, for simplicity, we only consider the images with the same size.***"
