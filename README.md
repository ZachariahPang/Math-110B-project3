note:`Steg-NN-Two-Secret-Image-Past-Due.ipynb` was unploaded after the due date. It has the best performance using a even deeper network.

---

|----misc: some miscellaneous files used during the development

|----models: saved weights for the neural network

|----Resize-test-img.ipynb: downsize the tesing images to match the training images

|----Steg-LSB: LSB implementation

|----Steg-NN-Single-Secret-Image.ipynb: Neural network implementations for a single secret image

|----Steg-NN-Single-Secret-Image.ipynb: Neural network implementations for two secret images 

|---Steg-NN-Two-Secret-Image-Past-Due.ipynb: containes the so far best network architecture. This particular file took 9 hours to train and it's finished after the due date.
